<h1>My marvellous boring life</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Giulio, and I'm from Italy!</p>
<p>I love to make my life harder, so I started to code with esolangs</p>
<p>I try to be a COBOL developer. Yes IBM, I really like money</p>
<p>Jk apart, I really like COBOL and Fortran, but a lot of their code is closed source</p>
<p>So I tought: "Why shouldn't I develop open source on the most closed source language?"</p>
<p>My other two passions are history and music, and I am working to programs on these topics</p>
