<h1>My mâ’¶rvellous boring life</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Giulio, and I'm from Italy!</p>
<p>BSD fan! Let's take the Unix world to human beings</p>
<p>I love to make my life harder, so I started to code with esolangs</p>
<p>I try to be a COBOL developer. Yes IBM, I really like money.</p>
<p>Jk apart, I really like COBOL and Fortran, but a lot of their code is closed source.</p>
<p>So I tought: "Why shouldn't I develop open source on the most closed source language?"</p>
<p>At school I study C# and Swift, so I will publish some programs with them, too</p>
<p>My other two passions are history and music, and I am working to programs on these topics</p>
<p>I also repair mechanical calculators and typewriters:</p>
<p>I have 4 Olivetti, 3 typewriters and a calculator, I also have a Totalia Multisumma, another mechanical calculator.</p>
